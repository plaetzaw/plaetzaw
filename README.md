 Hi there, I'm Alex Plaetzer

I am a former full time swim coach. After over a decade of coaching at the collegiate, high school and club level - I decided I wanted to refocus my carrer into software engineering 
 
After going through a code bootcamp with [DigitalCrafts](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/). Afterward I did an engineering apprenticeship with [gitBabel](https://www.gitbabel.com/).

Currently a junior full-stack developer with gitBabel.
